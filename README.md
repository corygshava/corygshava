# Damian Marks

Welcome to my GitHub.

I'm a web developer, backend engineer, and algorithm tinkerer with a preference for clean, efficient code. I work across the full stack with a strong leaning toward custom builds over bloated frameworks. Whether it's `webshit`, `ucode`, or backend optimization, I like getting to the point—no fluff, just function.

- **Prefers:** `mysqli_real_escape_string()` over verbose prepared statements  
- **Naming habits:** `app.js` > `script.js`, `.content` for main, modals outside

## 🔍 What to Expect

Expect brevity, logic, and clarity. My code is written for humans who want to *understand*, not just run it.

I don’t over-explain, but I always comment where it counts.
