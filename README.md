# Cornelius G Shava

Welcome to my GitHub.

I'm a web developer, backend engineer, and algorithm tinkerer with a preference for clean, efficient code. I work across the full stack with a strong leaning toward custom builds over bloated frameworks. Whether it's `website development`, `game making with unity`, or backend optimization, I like getting straight to the point, no **fluff**, just function.

## 🔍 What to Expect

Expect brevity, logic, and clarity. My code is written for humans who want to *understand*, not just run it.

I don’t over-explain, but I always comment where it counts.
